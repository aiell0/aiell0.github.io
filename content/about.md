Hey there! My name is Lawrence Aiello and I am a seasoned technology professional with over 10 years of experience. I have held roles as a Software Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, Consultant, and now as a DevOps Engineer.

I mostly specialize in Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes, and Docker deployments. I will be using these space to muse about these topics and others as I go along my tech journey.
