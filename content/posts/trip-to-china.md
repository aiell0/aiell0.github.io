# Digital Nomad in China

Recently, I had the opportunity to travel in China with my partner. It was a month long trip and was a mixture of pleasure (via sightseeing) and personal (my partner's family is from there). Given that I recently joined my company and due to the length of the trip, I did not have the luxury of taking too much time off. I love a challenge, so I decided to work east coast US hours from Asia. Yes, you read that right. For a month straight, I worked from 12am - 8am every weekday. In this article, I want to both share a little of what I saw there, and also provide some tips should you want to do the same.

I am very fortunate to work for a company ([Redesign Health](https://www.redesignhealth.com/)) that values flexibility and allows full-time WFH. Given this opportunity, I am fortunate enough to be able to do these things. So the first bit of advice I have is to make sure your company is ok with you doing this! Even if your company allows WFH, it may have policies that prevent you from traveling in this capacity. I used to work for Amazon and this would have been a hard "no" for them.

# First Stop: [Tokyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo)

So truth be told, I didn't actually work from Tokyo. I was only there for a few days as we were en route to China (Beijing specifically). I imagine working from Tokyo would have been easy. The internet was fast, and it had a great metro system. Something that surprised me about Tokyo was how inexpensive it was. It's one of the [most livable cities](https://www.reuters.com/plus/tokyo-asias-bustling-very-livable-financial-capital) right now. Despite how populated it is, it didn't feel stuffy and the city is very clean. People are also very polite and nice. The hardest challenge of working from here would be the time difference, but that exists for all of Asia.

# Second Stop: [Beijing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing)

Beijing was where I spent my first working week. Due to all the excitement of having never been in Asia before, this week wasn't too bad as I was able to power through the crazy schedule through sheer adrenaline and excitement. Upon arriving though, one thing you will notice quickly is that the internet does not work the same way that it does in other countries. The [Great Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall) is very much real, and excludes most western companies. That means if you do not prepare yourself, you will have a bad experience. Before you go to China, if you wish to work I suggest the following:

1. Ensure your phone service provider will work. I have [Google Fi](https://fi.google.com/about?pli=1) and with the Unlimited Plus subscription, I had phone service throughout my entire trip, and was able to access service outside of the firewall. This way, I was able to use my hotspot for much of my trip. I can comfortably say that Google Fi saved my behind multiple times throughout my trip. 

2. If you wish to use wifi *anywhere* in China, you will be under the firewall. The VPN service I use in the US did not work in China, that is blocked as well. One service I found that worked was [this one](https://my.yunti.io/auth/login) - just be aware you will need a translator to use it. I had to pay a small amount but it was worth it. Even with this though, some websites still did not work well and I had to go back to my hotspot.

During the week, on Monday I would usually take a short nap from 7pm - 11pm or so, and then work from 12am - 8am. Following this, I would spend the rest of the morning and early afternoon seeing the sights and eating delicious food. Then around 3pm or so, I would go back to my hotel and head to sleep, doing it all again the next day. The biggest challenge was having to go to sleep in the middle of the afternoon, as it is going against your body's natural cycle.

Beijing has a lot to see, but one piece of advice I will give is try to avoid rush hour if you can. Beijing is *insanely* populated, I have never seen so many people in my life. I live in NYC, and NYC feels very manageable after Beijing. You will be crammed on the trains and will be pushed around a lot. It is best to avoid it if you can. Additionally, the city is very spread out so anywhere you go will probably take a while to get to.

# Third Stop: [Hangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou)

I spent the second and third week of my trip here. We stayed with family, so it was a bit more comfortable in terms of living space. This city is home to many technology companies in China (Ant Group, Alibaba Group) and is similar to our Silicon Valley.

At this point in my trip, the excitement was wearing off and the realities of the schedule were setting in. We were tired. Thus, we didn't do as much sightseeing as Beijing as we needed to be able to get through this marathon we were putting ourselves through. However, it was well worth it. Coffee was a big help, as it always is. I would also suggest finding a room without windows. Looking outside into the dark for most of the workday does not lend itself to feeling super productive. My most productive parts of the day happened at the end of my workday when it began to get light outside.

# Final Stop: [Shanghai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai)

We took a bullet train from Hangzhou to Shanghai. Which by the way, made me feel super depressed as an American because you realize how far behind the US is in infrastructure. This train went hundreds of miles an hour, and the train stations were nicer than any airport I have been to in America. I will never look at Amtrak the same way.

As tired as I was at this point, I loved the energy of Shanghai and caught a second wind of energy at this point in the trip. The vibe in Shanghai was very different from the other two cities, it felt much more international and worldly. It is more condensed than Beijing so it didn't take as long to go from place to place, and the food was amazing.
