The past few winters, I have been traveling to warmer climates during a portion of it to get a break from the cold weather. I imagine at some point in my future, I will eventually be spending most of winter in another place. So this issue of &amp;ldquo;Digital Nomad&amp;rdquo; will be concerning my brief time spent in Latin America, specifically Colombia.</description></item><item><title>Digital Nomad: China</title><link>https://aiell0.github.io/nomad/china/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 16:25:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://aiell0.github.io/nomad/china/</guid><description>Digital Nomad in China Recently, I had the opportunity to travel in China. It was a month long trip and was a mixture of pleasure (sightseeing) and personal (my partner&amp;rsquo;s family is from there). Given that I recently joined my company and due to the length of the trip, I did not have the luxury of taking too much time off. I love a challenge, so I decided to work west coast US hours from Asia.</description></item></channel></rss>
