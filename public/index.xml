&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never met a person that really enjoys the Northeastern winters, we just deal with it. The past few winters, I have been traveling to warmer climates during a portion of it to get a break from the cold weather. I imagine at some point in my future, I will eventually be spending most of winter in another place. So this issue of &amp;ldquo;Digital Nomad&amp;rdquo; will be concerning my brief time spent in Latin America, specifically Colombia. I will briefly go over the two cities I visited and worked from, and at the end give some pros/cons if you are considering a trip like this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Digital Nomad: China</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/nomad/china/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;digital-nomad-in-china&#34;&gt;Digital Nomad in China&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had the opportunity to travel in China. It was a month long trip and was a mixture of pleasure (sightseeing) and personal (my partner&amp;rsquo;s family is from there). Given that I recently joined my company and due to the length of the trip, I did not have the luxury of taking too much time off. I love a challenge, so I decided to work west coast US hours from Asia. Yes, you read that right. For a month straight, I worked from 12am - 8am every weekday. In this article, I want to share a little of what I saw there, and also offer some tips if you want to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey there! My name is Lawrence Aiello and I am a seasoned technology professional with over 10 years of experience. I have held roles as a Software Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, Consultant, and now as a DevOps Engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/bio.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Portugal&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mostly specialize in Terraform, AWS, Kubernetes, and Docker deployments. I will be using these space to muse about these topics and others as I go along my tech journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;arch-adventures-installing-awsssm&#34;&gt;Arch Adventures: Installing AWS SSM&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my DevOps side projects as of late has been setting up blockchain nodes. Since proof of stake has really taken hold a few years back, we are seeing a Cambrian explosion of projects all using proof of stake to secure their network. It is the perfect environment for DevOps engineers to practice their craft as there is and will need to be a huge DevOps need to power these networks as they continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
