## Tips to my future self

Run the following to serve locally:

* git submodule init
* git submodule update

To add a post:

* hugo new posts/post.md 

If getting errors running `hugo server`, update module by git cloning into the `themes` folder.

Also remember to set custom domain in the Github "Pages" setting as it keeps getting removed when PRs are merged (not sure why).
