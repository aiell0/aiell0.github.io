There are two main reasons why I have not picked up the Rust language until recently:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The learning curve seems steep for a language that I may not end up using on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most of the learning material is too theoretical and not practical enough for me to understand how these concepts are applied in real-world projects.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The first point is no longer a concern as I now work at &lt;a href="https://rogo.ai">a company&lt;/a> that uses Rust in production. The second point is what motivated me to finally pick up the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Month-Lunches-David-MacLeod/dp/1633438236">&lt;em>Learn Rust in a Month of Lunches&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. It promised to be an approachable guide to Rust that is practical and immediately applicable to real-world projects. Seduced by these promises, along with the confidence of Amazon&amp;rsquo;s 30-day money back guarantee, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Book Review: Rust in a Month of Lunches</title><link>https://aiell0.github.io/posts/book-review-rust-in-a-month-of-lunches/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Oct 2024 13:46:38 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://aiell0.github.io/posts/book-review-rust-in-a-month-of-lunches/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have attempted to learn Rust many times over the past few years.

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve never met a person that really enjoys the Northeastern winters, we just deal with it. The past few winters, I have been traveling to warmer climates during a portion of it to get a break from the cold weather. I imagine at some point in my future, I will eventually be spending most of winter in another place. So this issue of &amp;ldquo;Digital Nomad&amp;rdquo; will be concerning my brief time spent in Latin America, specifically Colombia. I will briefly go over the two cities I visited and worked from, and at the end give some pros/cons if you are considering a trip like this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Digital Nomad: Colombia</title><link>https://aiell0.github.io/posts/colombia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 07:56:50 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://aiell0.github.io/posts/colombia/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="digital-nomad-in-colombia">Digital Nomad in Colombia&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Recently, I had the opportunity to travel in China. It was a month long trip and was a mixture of pleasure (sightseeing) and personal (my partner&amp;rsquo;s family is from there). Given that I recently joined my company and due to the length of the trip, I did not have the luxury of taking too much time off. I love a challenge, so I decided to work west coast US hours from Asia. Yes, you read that right. For a month straight, I worked from 12am - 8am every weekday. In this article, I want to share a little of what I saw there, and also offer some tips if you want to do the same.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Digital Nomad: China</title><link>https://aiell0.github.io/posts/digital-nomad-china/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Nov 2023 16:25:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://aiell0.github.io/posts/digital-nomad-china/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="digital-nomad-in-china">Digital Nomad in China&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>One of my DevOps side projects as of late has been setting up blockchain nodes. Since proof of stake has really taken hold a few years back, we are seeing a Cambrian explosion of projects all using proof of stake to secure their network. It is the perfect environment for DevOps engineers to practice their craft as there is and will need to be a huge DevOps need to power these networks as they continue to grow.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Arch Adventures: Installing AWS SSM</title><link>https://aiell0.github.io/technical-articles/arch-adventures-installing-aws-ssm/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jul 2023 16:25:16 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://aiell0.github.io/technical-articles/arch-adventures-installing-aws-ssm/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="arch-adventures-installing-awsssm">Arch Adventures: Installing AWS SSM&lt;/h1>
