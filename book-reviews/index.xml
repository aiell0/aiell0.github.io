There are two main reasons why I have not picked up the Rust language until recently:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The learning curve seems steep for a language that I may not end up using on a day-to-day basis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most of the learning material is too theoretical and not practical enough for me to understand how these concepts are applied in real-world projects.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>The first point is no longer a concern as I now work at &lt;a href="https://rogo.ai">a company&lt;/a> that uses Rust in production. The second point is what motivated me to finally pick up the book &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Month-Lunches-David-MacLeod/dp/1633438236">&lt;em>Learn Rust in a Month of Lunches&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. It promised to be an approachable guide to Rust that is practical and immediately applicable to real-world projects. Seduced by these promises, along with the confidence of Amazon&amp;rsquo;s 30-day money back guarantee, I decided to give it a shot.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
